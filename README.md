### Hi there üëã
I am Alessio Lama, a self-proclaimed frontend programmer. I enjoy creating games with JavaScript or making discord bots (with JavaScript). I enjoy working with MongoDB, because it's JavaScript.
I am trying to learn Electron.js, so I can use JavaScript even for applications () => {üëç}
